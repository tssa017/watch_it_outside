                <p class="py-3">
                    Founded in 1931 by Theressa Malone, the Watch it outside Boston
                    edition film festival is today one of the most important
                    international events in contemporary performing arts. Every
                    year, in July, Boston becomes a theater city, transforming its
                    architectural heritage into various performance venues, majestic
                    or astonishing, previousl welcoming <strong>1500</strong> film lovers of
                    all generations.</p>
                    <p>The Festival achieves the original alliance of a popular
                        audience with international creation. Boston is also a spirit:
                        the city is an open-air forum, where festival-goers talk about
                        the films and share their experiences as spectators. For one
                        month, everyone can have access to contemporary and living
                        culture. The program is made up of films, but also readings and
                        debates, which are all entries into the world of the invited
                        artists and intellectuals. Every evening at the Festival, there
                        is one special “premiere”, Theressa Malone's "The Man on the
                        Boat", which makes Boston a true place of creation and
                        adventure, for artists and spectators alike.</p>
