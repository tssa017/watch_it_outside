# Watch it outside Boston Edition

I built this fim festival's website as project 3 for the OpenClassrooms Full-stack Developer path. It is built with HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. The objective was to develop a first version of the site.

## To view the project

Simply re-direct to [this netlify app](https://watch-it-outside-openclassrooms.netlify.app/)

Or clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tssa017/watch_it_outside.git
```

## For developers

To install Tailwind CSS, use the following command:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

To compile the Tailwind CSS live, use the following command:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/css/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
```

Happy viewing! üçø
